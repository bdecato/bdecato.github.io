I implemented the default RShiny app following the instructions on
[the Shiny RStudio tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html)
and am hosting it on shinyapps.io under my free account.
Unfortunately it appears prohibitively difficult to embed this app in my website,
so the strategy I will employ when I want to share RShiny apps is to write a
plain Markdown blog post and simply link to it, as below:
