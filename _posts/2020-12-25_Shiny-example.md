I implemented the default RShiny app following the instructions on
https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/shinyapps.html and am hosting it on
https://bdecato.shinyapps.io. Unfortunately it appears prohibitively difficult
to embed this app in my website, so the strategy I will employ when I want to
share RShiny apps is to write a plain Markdown blog post and simply link to
it, as below:
