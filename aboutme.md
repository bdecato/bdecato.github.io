I can say the phrase "I don't know" in approximately ten languages! My last name is pronounced duh-kay-toe. I have a soft spot for one particular [Chemist](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilydecato/). My not so professional hobbies include rock climbing, camping, soccer, snowboarding, art and music, traveling (except red-eye flights), and (perhaps badly) cooking!
