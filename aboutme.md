Testing this linke again. [Research Investigator](http://www.bms.com)

<p> I am a Research Investigator in the Translational Bioinformatics department of <a href="http://www.bms.com">Bristol-Myers Squibb</a>. Prior to BMS, I earned a Ph.D in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics from the <a href="http://www.dornsife.usc.edu/cbb/">Department of Molecular and Computational Biology</a> at the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/">University of Southern California</a>, working in the lab of <a href="http://www.smithresearch.org">Dr. Andrew Smith</a>.  Before starting at USC in 2012, I completed a B.S. in Computer Science from the <a href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/">University of New Hampshire</a>, and did research in Bioinformatics with my undergraduate advisor, <a href="http://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh/">Dr. Phil Hatcher</a>.  A full PDF CV is available <A HREF="papers/cv_2019.pdf">here</A>, although there is no guarantee it is entirely up-to-date (last updated Pi day, 2019). A more professional picture (no mountains) is available on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/benjamin-decato-1215a116

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
