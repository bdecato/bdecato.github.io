When I'm not doing science things, I enjoy spending time with
[my wife Lily](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lilydecato) and our two cats,
Dodle (Noodles -> Noodle -> Doodle -> Dodle) and Cheto (Cheeto -> Cheto).
Pre-pandemic we loved to travel, but cooking food from around the world will
have to do for now!

I'm a big fan of the outdoors, and enjoy camping, backpacking, rock climbing,
snowboarding, and other things along those lines. I am looking forward to
getting involved in conservation in 2021 as well, to ensure these hobbies
remain accessible for future generations.

I'm currently reading (and very much enjoying) "The Emperor of All Maladies: A
Biography of Cancer" by Siddhartha Mukherjee.

I have a ukulele and guitar close to my desk at home, and learning something new
on those can be fun and satisfying when the mood strikes, though I don't claim
to be a real musician!
