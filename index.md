Hello and thanks for visiting! I'm Ben Decato, a Senior
Scientist in the Translational Bioinformatics department at
[Bristol Myers Squibb](www.bms.com), focusing on clinical biomarker discovery
and development in non-oncology diseases including heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

I earned a Ph.D in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in 2018 from the
[Department of Molecular and Computational Biology](http://www.dornsife.usc.edu/cbb)
at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), working in the
lab of [Dr. Andrew Smith](https://www.smithlabresearch.org). Before starting at
USC in 2012, I completed a B.S. in Computer Science from the
[University of New Hampshire](https://www.cs.unh.edu), and did research in
Bioinformatics with my undergraduate advisor, [Dr. Phil Hatcher](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh).

My full CV is available [here](Papers/CV_BDecato_010121.pdf), although there is no guarantee
it is entirely up-to-date. A complete suite of contact options are shown below,
and I am always open to new collaborations, github pull requests, and
opportunities. Hope to hear from you soon!
