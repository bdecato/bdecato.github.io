subtitle: Assistant Research Professor, Bioinformatics at City of Hope
---

Hello and thanks for visiting! I'm Ben Decato, an assistant research professor
of bioinformatics working in the lab of [Dr. Andrea Bild](https://bildlab.org)
at [City of Hope National Medical Center](https://www.cityofhope.org)
in the Department of Medical Oncology and Therapeutics Research. My research
in the Bild lab focuses on understanding the evolutionary trajectories of
cancer clonal populations over time, and devising treatment strategies
to combat treatment-resistant phenotypes.

Prior to City of Hope, I worked as a Research Investigator and then Senior
Scientist in the Translational Bioinformatics department at
[Bristol Myers Squibb](www.bms.com), focusing on clinical biomarker discovery
and development in non-oncology diseases including heart failure with preserved
ejection fraction, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

I earned a Ph.D in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics in 2018 from the
[Department of Molecular and Computational Biology](http://www.dornsife.usc.edu/cbb)
at the [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu), working in the
lab of [Dr. Andrew Smith](https://www.smithlabresearch.org). Before starting at
USC in 2012, I completed a B.S. in Computer Science from the
[University of New Hampshire](https://www.cs.unh.edu), and did research in
Bioinformatics with my undergraduate advisor, [Dr. Phil Hatcher](https://www.cs.unh.edu/~pjh).

My full CV is available [here](Papers/CV_BDecato_020121.pdf), although there is no guarantee
it is entirely up-to-date. A complete suite of contact options are shown below,
and I am always open to new collaborations, github pull requests, and
opportunities. Hope to hear from you soon!
