Broadly, I am interested in understanding how somatic mutation and epigenetic
regulation of genomes contributes to cellular differentiation, speciation, and
disease. My exploration of the [epi]genome has often involved implementation of
custom algorithms and pipelines for analysis of next-generation sequencing
technologies, and occasionally the development of new statistical or
computational theory. Since joining BMS, I have focused primarily on applying
my background to understanding the intricacies of and evaluating potential
therapies for a broad range of diseases.</p>
